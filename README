NAME
    DJabberd::Plugin::Balancer - Load balancing djabberd plugin

SYNOPSIS
      <VHost ...>
        <Plugin DJabberd::Plugin::Balancer/>
        ...
      </VHost>

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple load balancer plugin for djabberd that works by
    distributing all the messages for a single fully qualified JID through
    several clients.

    Every time a client binds to a resource, this plugin will record that
    trial and return a different resource, including a sufix in the #999
    format. The original JID will be saved as a load balancing endpoint.
    Other clients then can try to bind to the same resource, and will also
    be assigned different JIDs, but all that will be recorded.

    If some client, on the other hand, tries to bind to the resource of
    another real client (already with the #999 sufix), the bind will be
    denied.

    When a message arrives for the load-balancing-endpoint JID, it will be
    dispatched randomly through all the clients that tried to bind to that
    resource.

    Messages to the real JIDs will be delivered normally, iq stanzas will
    work as expected, since when sending that, the client will send using
    the JID assigned by the server.

DIFFERENCES
    Unlike the default behaviour, on a real-JID conflict, the new connection
    will be dropped, and not the old one.
